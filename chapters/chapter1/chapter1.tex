\chapter{Bayesian Theory - Introduction and Motivation}

Bayesian statistics is a way of thinking that turns the whole idea of probability into something personal. Instead of seeing probability as some fixed, external truth, we use it to represent our own uncertainty about the world. Imagine you're trying to predict the outcome of a coin toss. A frequentist might say that the probability of heads is 50\%, based on the fact that a fair coin lands heads half the time in the long run. A Bayesian, however, goes deeper—asking, \textit{What do I believe about this specific coin and this particular toss, given all the evidence I have?}\\

This shift in perspective is key to Bayesian thinking. We don’t just rely on data; we also take into account our prior beliefs. As we gather more information, we update those beliefs—refining our understanding of the world in a way that reflects both the evidence at hand and what we thought beforehand.\\

Now, you might be wondering: how does this contrast with traditional statistics? Well, the difference boils down to how we interpret probability itself. Bayesian and frequentist approaches both use probability to make sense of uncertainty, but they come at it from entirely different angles. Let’s explore that in the next section  \cite{introtobayesianthinking}.
